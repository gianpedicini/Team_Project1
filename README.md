# team_project1


The first project assigned to us during the Develhope bootcamp involved studying and analyzing the "Northwind" database. In particular, during various tasks, we focused on extracting insights to improve the revenue of the "Northwind" company.
Every query is written in SQLite, in a DBeaver Client.

Task 1
- Extract insights on the countries to which the company sells its products.
- Extract information on categories by country.

Task 2 
- Calculate the total sales amount for the company in the years 2016, 2017, and 2018 using the Orders and Order Details tables.
- Categorize countries based on the sales amount into three categories: low, medium, and high.
- Determine the threshold for each category based on the normal distribution of sales and/or empirically justified thresholds using the data.
   
Task 3
- Calculate the top 3 best-selling products (individual task).

Task 4
- Generate a report on the number of territories each employee is responsible for.
- Generate a report on employee performance based on the sales amount and rank them in descending order.
- Compare the two reports.

Task 5
- Determine the product category shipped to regions with low sales.
- Calculate the average shipping date for each category in regions with low sales and compare it to the required shipping date.
- Calculate the effects of discounts in regions with low sales compared to regions with high sales.
